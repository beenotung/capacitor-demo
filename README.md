# capacitor-demo

Demo how to turn a webapp into hybrid mobile app.

Also demo how to select photo and preview before upload.

Modified based on [ionic-vanilla-router-demo](https://github.com/beenotung/ionic-vanilla-router-demo)

## Why not using it without a client-side-rederning framework?

This demo serve as a demo to whom just get started on frontend development (with only knowledge on HTML/CSS and Javascript DOM APIs).

This can also serve as a base stone for hybrid mobile app.
