# ionic-vanilla-router-demo

This repo demostrates how to use ionic components and it's built-in client-side rendering router to build single-page-app in vanilla js (without angular/vue/react nor stencil).

Online Demo: https://ionic-vanilla-router-demo.surge.sh

Ionic Documentation: https://ionicframework.com/docs/

## Why not using it without a client-side-rederning framework?

This demo serve as a demo to whom just get started on frontend development (with only knowledge on HTML/CSS and Javascript DOM APIs).

This can also serve as a base stone for hybrid-rendered PWA.

For example, server-side-rendering the initial page, then use client-side rendering for the rest of pages as progressive enhancement when javascript is available, and fallback to pure server-side rendering when js is not available).
